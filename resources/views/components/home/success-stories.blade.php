                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">We are pleased to announce baby Brian's successful rescue and arrival at the Fountain of Peace Children's Foundation, Bethel Babies' Home. Baby Brian arrived at 6 months old after being abandoned. By the time Fountain of Peace got to know about his situation, Brian was severely malnourished and in desperate need of medical attention. Since he arrived at our babies' home, Brian has recovered well, and we are working hard to make sure that he gains full recovery. We believe Brian will become a strong leader with a powerful testimony. Please consider joining our rescue efforts and donate towards the work of Fountain of Peace by clicking here. Thank you.</p>
