Over 300 vulnerable children receive quality education at Rwenjaza Hillside Nursery and Primary School, equipping them with the skills to break the cycle of poverty.

                    Additionally, more than 20 wells have been constructed, providing nearby communities with access to safe drinking water and promoting health and stability. The Mothers Matter in Childbirth program ensures pregnant mothers receive essential medical care for safe deliveries. Guided by compassion and a commitment to lasting impact, FOP continues to uplift children and communities with the support of like-minded partners.
